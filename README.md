# AWS Security Operations Center

## Overview

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the establishment of a robust security operations center stands as a cornerstone for proactive threat detection and swift incident response. Our project aims to build a cloud-based security operations center that is not only scalable and automated but also adept at centralizing security monitoring, incident detection, and response capabilities. Over the course of ten weeks, our focus will be on crafting core functionalities within the AWS cloud platform, aiming to empower Security Operations Professionals, IT Security Teams, and Security Analysts with a resilient infrastructure that adapts to the dynamic nature of modern cyber threats. In total, there will be 5 sprints that will build from one to another.

Through design, deployment, and configuration, we are seeking to fortify the digital defenses of organizations, using the power of the cloud for security vigilance. By leveraging the flexibility and scalability of cloud computing, our SOC project will provide a comprehensive solution for managing security events and incidents effectively, ensuring that potential threats are identified and addressed promptly. This initiative not only addresses the pressing need for centralized security operations but also underscores the significance of automation in streamlining processes and enhancing overall responsiveness to emerging threats.
