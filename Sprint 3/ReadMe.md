Welcome to Sprint 3: Security Data Collection & Aggregation
Welcome to the third sprint of our project, focused on the critical task of Security Data Collection & Aggregation. In this sprint, we have undertaken significant steps to enhance the security posture of our infrastructure by building robust mechanisms for data ingestion and log management. Here, you'll find a detailed overview of our technical implementations and the strategies we've employed to ensure comprehensive security monitoring.

Key Components of Sprint 3:
1. Security Data Ingestion Pipelines:

Design & Implementation: We have meticulously designed and implemented automated pipelines to collect security data from a multitude of sources. This includes data from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint security agents.
Centralized Log Management: All ingested data is funneled into a centralized log management platform, ensuring a single point of reference for all security-related information. This centralization is crucial for efficient monitoring and quick incident response.
2. Log Management & Normalization:

Configuration: Our log management platform is configured to normalize and enrich logs. This process involves transforming the logs into a standard format, making it easier to analyze and correlate data from different sources.
Enrichment: Beyond normalization, the logs are enriched with additional context, such as geolocation data or threat intelligence, to enhance the depth and accuracy of our analysis.
Efficient Analysis & Threat Detection: The structured and enriched logs enable powerful analytics capabilities, facilitating rapid threat detection and response.
